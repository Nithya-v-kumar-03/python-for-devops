# Precedence of Operations in Python

## Introduction

Precedence of operations in Python defines the order in which different types of operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

## Examples

### Arithmetic Precedence

```python
result = 5 + 3 * 2
# Multiplication has higher precedence, so result is 11, not 16
```
