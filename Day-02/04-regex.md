# Regex

**1. Regular Expressions for Text Processing:**

- A regular expression (often abbreviated regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. You can use it to   check whether strings match a pattern, to extract substrings, split strings, replace parts of them, and so on
- Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing.
- The `re` module in Python is used for working with regular expressions.
- Common metacharacters: `.` (any character), `*` (zero or more), `+` (one or more), `?` (zero or one), `[]` (character class), `|` (OR), `^` (start of a line), `$` (end of a line), etc.
- Examples of regex usage: matching emails, phone numbers, or extracting data from text.
- `re` module functions include `re.match()`, `re.search()`, `re.findall()`, and `re.sub()` for pattern matching and replacement.
